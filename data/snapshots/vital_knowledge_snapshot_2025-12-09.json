This matters because it could restrict Nvidia's sales in China, although the impact is not seen as massively negative. The issue is not the main concern for AI stocks currently, with bigger worries being the rise of competitors like Gemini/TPU and financial sustainability of startups. Nvidia's revenue from China is nearly zero, but the company still sells chips to Chinese companies, so restrictions could affect these sales. The H200 chip is considered far inferior to competitors Blackwell and Rubin, which may make Chinese buyers reluctant to purchase it, potentially limiting Nvidia's market share in China.",
