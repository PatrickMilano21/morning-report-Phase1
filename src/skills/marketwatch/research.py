    Attempt to fetch top stories from MarketWatch for a given ticker.
    
    NOTE: MarketWatch uses DataDome bot protection which blocks automated access
    even with Basic Stealth Mode. This function attempts to navigate and extract
    content, but typically returns empty results due to blocking.
    
    What we tried to make it work:
    - Basic Stealth Mode (enabled automatically on Startup+ plans)
    - Proxies enabled (recommended for CAPTCHA solving)
    - Waiting up to 60 seconds for DataDome/blocking to complete
    - Listening for CAPTCHA solving events (browserbase-solving-started/finished)
    - Extracting with iframes=True to access DataDome iframe content
    - Checking for URL redirects after blocking completes
    - Checking for page content loading after blocking
    
    Result: DataDome protection is too aggressive for Basic Stealth Mode.
    MarketWatch consistently blocks access with a DataDome Device Check iframe.
    
    Potential solutions (not implemented):
    - Advanced Stealth Mode (requires Scale Plan) - might help but not guaranteed
    - Browserbase Identity (requires Scale Plan, beta) - if MarketWatch uses Cloudflare
    - Focus on Yahoo Finance instead (works with Basic Stealth)
